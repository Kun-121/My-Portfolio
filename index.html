            Hello! 
			I’m Kundan Harbansh, a passionate Machine Learning Engineering student with a strong foundation in data science, programming, and algorithms. 
            I’m eager to contribute my skills and continue learning in a professional environment.
          </p>
          <p>
            I have experience working with Python, TensorFlow, PyTorch, and various machine learning algorithms. I am looking forward to building impactful solutions using ML and AI.

          <h3>PROJECT-1:<br> Hate Speech Detection using Transformer</h3>
          <p>
            I have trained language representation model called BERT, which stands for Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers
            on a sentiment dataset to perform hate speech detection using Transformers in tweets and comments.

          <h3>PROJECT-2:<br> Next Word Prediction with NLP</h3>
          <p>
            Developed a LSTM based model by training on a dataset using Python and libraries like TensorFlow/Keras. The goal of this model is to predict the next word in a sentence, given a set of previously observed words.

          <h3>PROJECT-3:<br> Stock Prices Modeling through ML Models </h3>
          <p>
            Building machine learning prediction models using Python and Scikit-learn to predict stock prices.
            For this I have trained Logistic Regression, Support Vector Machine, XGBClassifier  and then based on their performance on the 
            training and validation data I will choose which ML model is performing the prediction with greater precision.
